      <description>CR - Catherine-Rose Stocks Rankin
An event entitled &amp;lsquo;Navigating ethical approval and access in social care research&amp;rsquo; was held on the 28th of January 2014. It provided an opportunity to discuss the routes for gaining ethical approval for social care research and to provide a platform for the launch of the guidance document developed by a working group led by Scottish government. In this episode, Catherine-Rose Stocks Ranking, Iriss Associate, speaks about supporting practitioners through the ethical research journey taken on the PROP (Practitioner Research and Older People) project.</description>
