      <description>JM - Janice McGhee
JM What I&amp;rsquo;ll be partly doing is drawing on a recently edited book that Lorraine and I have been involved in and are the editors of that is, has this title New Directions in Safeguarding Children and I&amp;rsquo;ll also be drawing on some of my work as the Social Work lead for the Administrative Data Research Centre. It&amp;rsquo;s a Centre that is funded by the ESRC. There is one in each of the four parts of the UK and it&amp;rsquo;s really intended to support and promote the use of data that is already routinely collected by Government, by Public Agencies, by the third sector and use that for research purposes.</description>
