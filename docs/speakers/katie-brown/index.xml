Part 2 of a talk by Katie Brown, recorded on 6th January 2012
KB So we had the &amp;lsquo;Tell Tam Tour&amp;rsquo;. So very exciting, very successful - there&amp;rsquo;s the man himself and there&amp;rsquo;s access to him.
Then we rolled out the next part of the journey which was called &amp;lsquo;Right Brilliant Things&amp;rsquo;, and this was focused on ensuring that we were asking children and young people not only about what they think should improve in the lives of children and young people, but actually what they themselves perceived as really important parts of their lives to celebrate - what they thought was happening really well for children and young people in Scotland.</description>
