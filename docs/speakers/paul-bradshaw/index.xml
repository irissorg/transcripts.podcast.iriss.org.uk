      <description>PB - Paul Bradshaw
Okay, so the study that I worked on is called &amp;lsquo;Growing Up In Scotland&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s a longitudinal study &amp;hellip; a longitudinal birth and child cohort study. So we are basically covering or tracking several groups of children from their early childhood, into sort of middle childhood, hopefully into adolescence and maybe beyond. It&amp;rsquo;s a study that is funded by Scottish government, funded by the Education Directorate, so a lot of what we do in the study is directed at producing evidence that can be used to inform policy making directly.</description>
