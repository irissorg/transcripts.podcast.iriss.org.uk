      <description>HW - Helen Whincup
Helen Whincup, teaching fellow at the University of Stirling, reflects on a qualitative study entitled &amp;lsquo;Involving Young People Messages from Research&amp;rsquo; which examines how young people feel involved or not in assessment and decision making. It was recorded at a Scottish Childcare Protection meeting on the 30th of April 2012.
HW This morning is thinking about some of the messages from research about what children have said about their feelings about being involved and I will also be drawing on the research that I have been doing.</description>
