Interviewees: Carron O&amp;rsquo;Byrne and Morag Dendy, North Lanarkshire Council and Gerry Kelly, In Control
MD We&amp;rsquo;ve really tried to put families at the centre and give people much more choice and control over the lives they want to live and the supports that they put around them, not necessarily traditional services within that, and helping people understand the individual budget that&amp;rsquo;s available to them makes such a big difference, but we are also clear that what works in adults in working out what budget is right, isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the same as what works for children and families, so the opportunity to test something out specifically around children and families is really exciting.</description>
