      <description>INT: Lifelong links is a project led by Family Rights Group and delivered by local authorities. It supports children and young people in care to connect with and develop relationships with family members and other people who care about the young person so that they can become part of a lasting support network. Anne Begbie, coordinator of the Lifelong Links service at Edinburgh City Council, tells us about their programme, the setup, aims and achievements.</description>
