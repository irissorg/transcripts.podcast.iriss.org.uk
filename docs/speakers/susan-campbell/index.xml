SC - Susan Campbell
MM Today we are joined by Susan Campbell, from the Social Care Ideas Factory. First of all before Susan tells us about the project, she is going to tell us a bit about herself.
SC Hi Michael, yes, my name is Susan Campbell and I am a self employed life coach and community worker, but I have been doing bits and pieces of work for the Social Care Ideas Factory on an off for the last 5 years now and this piece of work I am working on just now is called &amp;lsquo;Trendspotters&amp;rsquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s a really exciting piece of work that I am wanting to tell Michael all about today.</description>
