      <description>CL - Claire Lightowler
CL This recording was made on 8th May 2013 in Stirling. We were joined at Volunteer Development Scotland&#39;s office by a number of volunteers to talk about what motivates them to volunteer and what their experience of volunteering has been.
Welcome, I am Claire Lightowler from Iriss. It&#39;s 8th May and we are in Volunteer Development Scotland&#39;s offices in Stirling, and I am joined today by 9 volunteers who very kindly offered to talk about their experiences of volunteering.</description>
