MM On this podcast you will hear me speaking to some people from Indepen-dance. Indepen-dance is an award winning, inclusive dance company for disabled and non-disabled people to enjoy and fulfil their prospects through dance. So, I got to meet one of the team members of the company, Adam, who enjoys dancing and also I caught up with the founding member of the company, Karen Anderson.</description>
