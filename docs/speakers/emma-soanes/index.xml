MD On this podcast we&amp;rsquo;re going to hear from a number of different disability organisations and we&amp;rsquo;re going to be speaking about how they are coping and dealing with the current crisis. So first up we&amp;rsquo;re going to hear from an organisation called SPAEN. They are the Scottish Personal Employers Network. The network supports people with disabilities and long-term conditions in improving the use of self-directed support.</description>
