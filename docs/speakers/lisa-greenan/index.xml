SM Hello and welcome to our discussion around the duty of candour, my name is Stuart Muirhead and I&amp;rsquo;m a project manager in Iriss. The thinking for this discussion came from being out about in the social services sector, over the last year and getting the feeling that the duty of candour provisions were something that were either well known, or known of and also something that was possibly causing some anxiety or confusion, either that or they weren&amp;rsquo;t on people&amp;rsquo;s radar at all.</description>
