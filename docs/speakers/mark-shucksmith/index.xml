      <description>Kerry: So welcome everybody and thanks for joining us for this, another session in our rural social work forum series. So, today our focus is on rural lives, understanding financial wellbeing and vulnerability in Scotland and Iâ€™m delighted to have three of the four authors of the Rural Lives report with us today. So, Dr Jayne Glass, Professor Mark Shucksmith and Polly Chapman, so, thank you all for coming. So, the Rural Lives report which was published earlier this year; in March I believe, provides valuable insight into the vulnerabilities of people living in rural communities and challenges the dominant narratives which often see poverty as an urban only issue.</description>
