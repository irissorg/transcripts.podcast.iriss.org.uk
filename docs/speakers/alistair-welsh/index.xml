IW First of all, Alistair, we had a plan to create some support materials for people who were preparing to go along to committee meetings.
AW ... we have 2 members of TAG who are part of the committee for Key, and as part of assisting the guys in preparing for and contributing to committee meetings, one of the themes that we had looked at the use of the PSP for, was whether that through the short video segment it can offer, might that be a helpful way of the two members preparing for and contributing on the day of the meeting.</description>
