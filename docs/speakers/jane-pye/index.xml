KM Welcome everyone to this, our very first session in our online series about rural social work. Today on Thursday the 10th of December 2020, we start very aptly with the topic; Rural social work: what is it and why is it unique? We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to have so many of you here and I&amp;rsquo;m equally delighted to introduce Colin Turbett and Jane Pye, our two presenters.</description>
