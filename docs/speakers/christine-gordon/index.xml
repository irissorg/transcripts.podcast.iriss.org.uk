Adoptive or foster parents often believe they have failed and blame themselves for their children&#39;s violent or aggressive behaviour. It is important that professionals are &#39;trauma aware&#39; and dot reinforce these feelings. In this episode, Edwina Grant, Chair of Scottish Attachment in Action talks to Christine Gordon and Karen Wallace of Adapt Scotland about caring for those who care for children who exhibit violent or aggressive behaviour.</description>

How do we deal with trauma? Most of us have a reference point for what is &#39;safe&#39; which allows us to make sense of traumatic events (for example a car crash) and provides a framework to deal with it. Looked after or adoptive children often have no such reference point which makes it difficult for them and their parents to deal with trauma.</description>
