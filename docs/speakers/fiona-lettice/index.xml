How do we deal with trauma? Most of us have a reference point for what is &amp;lsquo;safe&amp;rsquo; which allows us to make sense of traumatic events (for example a car crash) and provides a framework to deal with it. Looked after or adoptive children often have no such reference point which makes it difficult for them and their parents to deal with trauma.</description>
