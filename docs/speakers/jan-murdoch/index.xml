MM You are listening to Iriss.fm and we are here with Jan Murdoch, Head of Corporate Affairs at the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disabilities, and Jan is going to be speaking to us about Learning Disability Week. Now before we speak about Learning Disability Week, can you tell us what is Learning Disability Week all about?
JM It&amp;rsquo;s a week to bring attention to the issues that are facing people with disabilities and their families, so it&amp;rsquo;s a change to think about what is happening locally or nationally and make a bit of a noise about it and to hopefully get some attention from people right across Scotland around the issues that are affecting people and their families.</description>
