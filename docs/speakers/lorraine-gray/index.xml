There&amp;rsquo;s More to Care Than Caring is a Scottish government led adult social care recruitment campaign which was launched in January 2020. It aims to encourage people to take up a career in care. Michelle from Iriss had a conversation with Lorraine Gray, Chief Executive of the Scottish Social Services Council about the purpose of the campaign, the importance of adult social care work and how people can get involved in promoting the campaign.</description>
