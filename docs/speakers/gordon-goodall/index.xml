MM Okay now at Iriss.fm we&#39;re joined by Gordon Goodall the Director of Limelight and Gordon the first question would be what is Limelight?
GG Well basically Limelight&#39;s an organisation that supports disabled musicians and provides professional training and employment with the largest employer of disabled musicians in Scotland and within that remit we also roll out a youth&#39;s programme to primary schools and to primary schools with Autism units, vision impairment units and hearing impairment units to encourage children to look at ways of developing skills in music and also drama but mainly music, and the reason for this is so that they can get transferrable skills that can lead to employment in other stratospheres of the, of the world basically.</description>
