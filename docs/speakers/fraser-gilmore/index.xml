      <description>Michael: On this episode for Iriss, I went to find out about an organisation called Care Opinion. So, I spoke to the head of Care Opinion in Scotland, Fraser Gilmore. Fraser has worked across the voluntary sector and senior management roles for almost 15 years.
So, can you tell us what Care Opinion is, Fraser please?
Fraser: Yes indeed, so Care Opinion is an online platform and it’s run by ourselves, Care Opinion and we’re an independent, not for profit, social enterprise.</description>
