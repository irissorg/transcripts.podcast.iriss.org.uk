      <description>Meylis: Hi, I’m Meylis from North Wales. I live here in Gwynedd and I’ve worked in Gwynedd for quite a few years. And currently I’m in a role across health and social care, leading a programme of change called the Community Transformation Programme. And one of the key things I’m working on and have been working on for a long time, is trying to change the way that we commission and deliver home care in Gwynedd.</description>
