My Support, My Choice is a research project led jointly by the Health and Social Care Alliance and Self-Directed Support Scotland with the aim of understanding peopleâ€™s experiences of self-directed support in Scotland. It was funded by the Scottish Government. Between November 2018 and February 2020 over 600 people who received self-directed support or had been assessed in the previous 12 months took part in this research.</description>
