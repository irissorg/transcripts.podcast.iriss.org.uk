      <description>GM - Geoff Mulgan
GM What I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about two things which I suspect are, if they&amp;rsquo;re not already, will be quite live in your sort of day jobs. One is about productivity and how do you cope with pressures on money and outputs and outcomes and so on, and the other is tools of innovation to help you get to better productivity.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you through some methods and frameworks and then apply it to one or two specific topics that at least some of you will have far more knowledge than me.</description>
