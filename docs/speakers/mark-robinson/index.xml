      <description>GB - Greg Burgess
MR - Dr Mark Robinson
GB I am Greg Burgess, I am the Choose Life Coordinator for North Lanarkshire which means I am the suicide prevention guy for North Lanarkshire Council. Choose Life started in 2002, it&#39;s the national strategy to reduce suicide in Scotland by 20% before 2013, so a 10 year plan. Each local authority was given a pot of money to spend on suicide prevention activity, that was the decision back then, so every local authority would receive a pot of money, pro rata looking at their general budgets and population.</description>
