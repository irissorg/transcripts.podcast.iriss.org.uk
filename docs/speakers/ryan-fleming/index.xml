RF - Ryan Fleming
MM Ok, now on Iriss.fm, and this series of hidden disabilities, we are going to speak to Ryan Fleming about the barriers and challenges that he faces day to day. First of all, Ryan, going back to when you were younger, what obstacles did you face?
RF Well I faced quite a number of obstacles when I was young, my big one I would say, was when I actually started nursery school because I simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it, it was far too much for me, the playing and all that, with other children, just simply did not happen and I don&amp;rsquo;t really think you got much help back then when I started, I mean you are talking the late 1990s here, you didn&amp;rsquo;t really get much support.</description>
