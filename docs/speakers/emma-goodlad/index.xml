So we are here today with Emma Goodlad from the Walking Towards Better Health project from the ALLIANCE Scotland. Now, Emma, can you first tell us what is this project all about?
EG Well, Walking Towards Better Health was set up to really, it&amp;rsquo;s a partnership programme between Paths For All and Health and Social Care ALLIANCE Scotland, and it&amp;rsquo;s really all about trying to encourage people who are living with long term conditions to become more active through walking, because it&amp;rsquo;s the most accessible form of physical activity and it&amp;rsquo;s got so many benefits come from it, so that was really, the whole premise of it was really just to think of a really simple way to try and encourage people living with any long term condition to become more active.</description>
