      <description>JS - Jonathan Sher
JS I came here from the States, specifically from North Carolina, and I can talk like this all the live long day if it would amuse and please you, but it&#39;s not actually how I talk, so I will just sort of go with what I know and lapse into it every once in a while if it would please you. But in North Carolina, I had the pleasure of being Chief Executive of an organisation which was called the North Carolina Child Advocacy Institute, and part of what we did was to create a coalition of organisations called, &#39;the Covenant with North Carolina&#39;s Children.</description>
