CR - Catriona Rowley
MM Now on Iriss.fm we are joined by Catriona Rowley from The Advocacy Project. Can you tell us what is advocacy if people don&#39;t know what it is?
CR Yes, so advocacy in one sentence - it&#39;s really just about helping people to speak up for themselves and say what they want. We don&#39;t tell them what they should say or what they should choose, it&#39;s all about helping them to say exactly what they think.</description>
