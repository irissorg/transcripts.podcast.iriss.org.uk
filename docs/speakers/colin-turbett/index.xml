CT Thanks very much folks and it&amp;rsquo;s a privilege to be here at the first of these talking social work sessions and I certainly hope it&amp;rsquo;s something that will continue, it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to see such large numbers interested in something like this. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m here tonight is because a result of a commission from Iriss, I&amp;rsquo;ve written this, now it was a collaborative effort and in a sense the story of this publication which only came off the press yesterday is a bit like the history of community social work which is what I want to talk about tonight and that history over the last fifty years since the 68 Act.</description>
