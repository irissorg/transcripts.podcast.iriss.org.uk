KM Welcome to this special podcast, the Centre for Youth &amp;amp; Criminal Justice are hosting to celebrate the CELCIS 2017 Festival of Residential Childcare. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about how residential childcare workers respond to offending in children&amp;rsquo;s houses. Everyone here, aside from myself and Debbie, works with young people who are looked after, so we really appreciate you all travelling and giving your time to meet with us for this conversation in Glasgow today.</description>
