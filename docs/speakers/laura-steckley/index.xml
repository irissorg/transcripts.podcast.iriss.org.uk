Food for Thought project grew out of research undertaken by the University of Stirling, into the symbolic role of food in foster and residential child care. Jane Alcorn, of Foster Care Associates, explains her experience in being part of the project, in particular working with academics. She mentions the difference between an evidence based practice and practice based evidence. Jane is followed by Laura Steckley of the University of Strathclyde who reflects on the pros and cons of co-production.</description>
