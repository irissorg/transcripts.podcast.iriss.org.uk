MD On this podcast we&amp;rsquo;re going to hear from a number of different disability organisations and we&amp;rsquo;re going to be speaking about how they are coping and dealing with the current crisis. So first up we&amp;rsquo;re going to hear from an organisation called SPAEN. They are the Scottish Personal Employers Network. The network supports people with disabilities and long-term conditions in improving the use of self-directed support.</description>

MM We are joined by Colin Millar, now Colin Millar is the Chief Executive of the Scottish Personal Assistant Employment Network, wow, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful. Colin and his team deal with Self Directed Support. So first off, can you tell us a bit about Self Directed Support?
CM Sure, Self Directed Support is the name that&amp;rsquo;s been given to a national strategy, so in November 2010, the Scottish Government started talking about folk having more choice and control and freedom over how their support needs are met, and the Self Directed Support strategy, aims to encourage folk to take a lot more control and have a lot more say over how they meet those needs.</description>
