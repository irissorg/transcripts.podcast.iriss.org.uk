GC - Greg Campbell
MM Ok, now on Iriss.fm we are going to be talking to Greg Campbell. Greg Campbell is a support worker. So, Greg, why did you want to get into this kind of work?
GC Well, I have always felt that I have been a very helpful and supportive person. I think that comes a lot from my family and the way I have been brought up, just a very caring and nurtured, supporting environment.</description>
