      <description>Michelle: Hello and welcome to the Iriss.fm podcast. I&amp;rsquo;m Michelle and in this episode I speak to Emma Law and Susan Shenkin about ENRICH Scotland, a programme of work that supports research in care homes, the results of which improve the lives of people who live in care homes, their families and care home staff. Emma and Susan are the Co-chairs of ENRICH. Emma has worked in the NHS for over 35 years and is the manager for the neuro progressive and dementia research network since June 2009.</description>
