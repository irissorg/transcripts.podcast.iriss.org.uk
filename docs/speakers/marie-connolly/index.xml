      <description>MC - Professor Marie Connolly
MC (unclear) Greetings to you. Greetings to you and greetings to you all. Thank you for inviting me and thank you to Viv, the University of Edinburgh, for making this possible. I was chief social worker in New Zealand at a time when reform was very much in the mind of the New Zealand Government, and so I&amp;rsquo;m going to share with you today some of the insights from that period of time because we did quite an integrated set of reforms between 2005 and 2010, and then I moved into my current role at the University of Melbourne and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of a number of ministerial committees that are advancing reform processes in child welfare both in Melbourne and in New South Wales.</description>
