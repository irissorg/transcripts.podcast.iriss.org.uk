      <description>JM - Jane Martin
Jane So it&#39;s really good to be here and excellent turn out I think we are going to rival the opening for the V &amp;amp; A and I actually didn&#39;t realise there was quite so many social workers. It&#39;s fair to say that in Dundee we have a very strong belief in the value of practitioner forum, that&#39;s particularly important given the disperse nature of our workforce and when Alan was here as Director of social work, he worked hard to introduce support and embed the approach, but in truth I think like other areas we have struggled to retain the concept, we&#39;ve found that our meetings were becoming poorly attended and actually there was a bit of a sense that they were turning into a meeting and greeting session.</description>
