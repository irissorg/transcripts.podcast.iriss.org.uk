      <description>Michelle: Hi there, welcome to the Iriss.fm podcast. Iâ€™m Michelle and in this episode, I speak to Andrew Bryers about Heart Community Teams. Heart is a new wellbeing model of service delivery for children and their families in East Ayrshire. It is an approach in keeping with the principles of human rights based, inclusive service design and delivery.
Andrew has been a social worker since 2007, and has worked in Scotland, London and Australia.</description>
