MM On this episode we&amp;rsquo;re going to be hearing from people with disabilities working on the frontline. So first up we&amp;rsquo;re going to be hearing from Scott Kennedy. Scott is registered blind and he is a support worker. Okay, so now we&amp;rsquo;re joined by Scott. So can you tell us, Scott, now because you&amp;rsquo;re registered blind and it affects your kind of central vision, how have you adapted to this crisis?</description>
