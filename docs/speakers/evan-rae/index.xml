ER - Evan Rae
MM Okay now on Iriss.fm we&#39;re going to be continuing our series on support workers and we are going to be talking to Evan Rae about his work as a support worker. So first off Evan why did you want to get into this kind of work?
ER I think initially it&#39;s always something that&#39;s been a kind of an interest for me, working with folk who have a learning disability or extra support needs or something.</description>
