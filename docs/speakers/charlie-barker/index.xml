MD We Chose to Climb was a three-day event or &amp;lsquo;climb&amp;rsquo; that was held over 16-18th March at the Arches in Glasgow. It was an event that brought together those interested in discussing and exploring the principles of self-directed support. Iriss.fm spoke to Charlie Barker of Social Care Ideas Factory - she tells us more about it.
MD Charlie, just tell me, you are the brain behind this event - what&amp;rsquo;s it all about?</description>
