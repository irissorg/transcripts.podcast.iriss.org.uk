MD Kinections was a three-year collaborative research project working with care homes across East Ayrshire to explore what community means for people who live, work and visit care homes with a particular focus on the experiences of people living with dementia. The project was a My Home Life Scotland initiative, lead by a team of researchers at the University of the West of Scotland and was funded by the Life Changes Trust.</description>
