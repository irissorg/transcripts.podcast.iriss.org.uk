RM - Rachael McKechnie
MM On this next podcast, I went to find out more about the all new Social Security Scotland where I was talking to Rachael McKechnie and first off, I asked her: what is Social Security Scotland?
RM Thank you Michael so, Social Security Scotland is the organisation that&amp;rsquo;s been established to deliver a subset of benefits that are being moved from the UK government up to the Scottish government so, those benefits are largely for people with disabilities so, the things like personal independence payment, disability living allowance, the carers, so, carers allowance is coming up and then another smaller number of benefits that are there to support people who are on a low income that need a bit of help to meet additional cost so, that&amp;rsquo;s things like the Sure Start Maternity Grant, DWP&amp;rsquo;s funeral payment and cold weather payments and winter fuel payments.</description>
