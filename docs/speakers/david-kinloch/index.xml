      <description>DK - David Kinloch
DK Hi, my name is David. I am from Stirling.
I would like to welcome you to this Conference. I hope that you enjoy the day, and I hope that you get a lot out of all the things that are happening today.
We are here today to talk about Forgotten Citizens. People that were kept out of society and forgotten about. People that had no rights, people who had no voice, and people who had no choices.</description>
