      <description>LH - Dr Louise Hill
LH The research study that I would like to tell you about is called &amp;lsquo;Revealing Lives&amp;rsquo; - a qualitative study with children and young people affected by parental alcohol problems. This was a PhD study that I completed at the University of Edinburgh with Barnardo&amp;rsquo;s Childcare organisation, and I used to work for Barnardo&amp;rsquo;s as a researcher and this was a piece of work that was kind of developed along the way and in discussion with services.</description>
