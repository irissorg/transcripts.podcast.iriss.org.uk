      <description>GM - Geetha Marcus
GM I&#39;m Geetha Marcus and I did a study around the experiences of Gypsy Traveller girls in Scottish schools some time ago, and before I started I thought - oh, by the way, Isaac, I hope I fulfil your strong women thing because that&#39;s, you know, you can tell me later if I fit the bill! So just a little bit about my journey, who I am and how I ended up here and how I ended up talking about Gypsies and Travellers when I&#39;m not myself a Gypsy or a Traveller, although I think there&#39;s some sort of a connection through the Indian connection, but I thought I&#39;d start with myself.</description>
