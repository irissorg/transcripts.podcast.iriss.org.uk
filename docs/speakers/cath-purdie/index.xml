In Edinburgh and the Lothians there are over 7,000 families supporting adults with an autistic spectrum condition. Pasda is a charity that offers support to parents, partners and siblings of adults with ASC. Executive Manager, Donna Nelson, and Cath Purdie, a carer, join Michael McEwan in a Glasgow cafe to explain how Pasda works in partnership with a whole range of organisations to help improve the health and wellbeing of families affected by ASC.</description>
