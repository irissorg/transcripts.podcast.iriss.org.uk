      <description>Kerry: It’s my great pleasure to introduce our speaker today, Iain Ramsay from the Office of the Chief Social Work Advisor. So, Iain became a professional advisor to government but before that he was Chief Social Work Officer in Aberdeenshire with experience across the Grampian area. He also chaired Social Work Scotland’s Resource Committee which included all 32 local authorities. So, that’s just to impress that he understands how remote and rural practice is different; the challenges, the opportunities and the strengths that it has.</description>
