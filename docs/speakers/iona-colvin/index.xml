IC - Iona Colvin
IC I am really pleased to be here, and really pleased to see you all, newly-qualified social workers. There&amp;rsquo;s a few people planted in the audience that I recognise who are certainly not newly-qualified social workers, but we&amp;rsquo;ll just ignore them and we&amp;rsquo;ll talk to you!
Ok, so my name is Iona Colvin and I&amp;rsquo;m the Chief Social Work Adviser for the Government, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this job for two years now, just over two years.</description>

IC - Iona Colvin
Welcome to the first episode in a new series, Freshly Squeezed, which aims to &amp;lsquo;squeeze&amp;rsquo; information and inspiration from key influencers in social services in Scotland. We hear how and why they are working in social services, what motivates them, and the people, books and music that inspire them. They also offer some golden nuggets of advice. To kick the series off, Michelle Drumm spoke to Iona Colvin, Chief Social Work Adviser for Scotland.</description>
