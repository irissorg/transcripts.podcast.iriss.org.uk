      <description>Michael: On this podcast I went to find out about a study that Glasgow University has undertaken. They’re interviewing people with learning disabilities about their Coronavirus. So, I was speaking to one of their researchers at Glasgow University, Roseann Maguire. Also, I spoke to one of their participants of this study, Sandy Stark.
So, Roseanne, tell us what this survey is about please.
Roseann: Well what it is, is, we wanted to provide data about the lives of the people with learning disabilities during the Covid pandemic.</description>
