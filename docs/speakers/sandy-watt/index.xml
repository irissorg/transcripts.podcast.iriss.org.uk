      <description>RI - Rikke Iversholt
SW - Sandy Watt
RI Thank you Sandy for talking to me today and congratulation on being Social Worker of the Year in Scotland.
SW Thanks very much.
RI What does it mean for you to receive this award?
SW Well I suppose I am still probably trying to come to terms with it - it was a bit of a shock at the time, but as I say, I feel quite comfortable with it now, I feel quite happy because I realise it&amp;rsquo;s more than just a personal award, it is a reflection on social work in general and my colleagues and everybody I have had contact with.</description>
