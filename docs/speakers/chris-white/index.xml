You are listening to My Life My Way on Iriss.fm and we are joined by Chris White today. Now basically Chris was in his 20s, he was doing okay, he was married, he had a good job and a decent social life. Then he started feeling worried and anxious about most things and quickly developed into feeling as though he couldn&amp;rsquo;t cope. He attended a kind of a day centre from 1995 to 1999, and in about 2002, Chris made the decision not to use the day centre.</description>
