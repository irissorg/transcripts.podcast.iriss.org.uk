EH - Emma Hill
MM We are here in the East Project in East Renfrewshire with the Project Coordinator, Emma Hill. So Emma, first tell us a bit about the project.
EH Yes, absolutely - the project is called the East Project - we have just began in East Renfrewshire in about September of this year. It&amp;rsquo;s a supported employment project, so we help individuals with learning disabilities and learning difficulties between the ages of 18-30 to look for employment opportunities - and that can be work experience, right up to paid employment.</description>
