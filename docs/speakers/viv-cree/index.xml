Viv So, hello everybody. I&amp;rsquo;m Viv Cree, I&amp;rsquo;m a Professor of social work studies at the University of Edinburgh. I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to meet with you today and really pleased at the response we&amp;rsquo;ve had to our project. This is the second of three seminars within Scottish Government and in our project, which has a website. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be sharing all the materials that have come from the project we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about today and the project we&amp;rsquo;re involved in now because what we&amp;rsquo;re doing right now is very much what&amp;rsquo;s called an impact project, which is about taking forward the findings from our research.</description>
