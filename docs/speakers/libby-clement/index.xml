      <description>Michael: On this podcast, I went to find out about this years’ Scottish Learning Disability Week. Scottish Learning Disability Week runs between the 2nd to the 8th of May. So, I spoke to Oonagh Brown who is the human rights program lead and Libby Clement, a digital communication advisor at the Scottish Commission for People with Learning Disabilities.
So, Libby, can you tell us a wee bit about this year’s learning Disability Week?</description>
