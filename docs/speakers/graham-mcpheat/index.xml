MD You&#39;re professor of Social Work isn&#39;t it up at University of Dundee?
MS Yeah.
MD And from a social work perspective then, what is the significance of social pedagogy really?
MS For me some of the significance is it&#39;s link back to some of the earlier ideas of Scottish social work, in particular Kilbrandon&#39;s idea of social education and Cole Brandon thought of social education as education in it&#39;s widest sense to work with individuals families and communities and if you think of the idea of social pedagogy then that is described as education in it&#39;s broadest sense as well so, there are obvious sort of linkages.</description>
