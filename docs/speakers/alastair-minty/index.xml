      <description>Michael: On this podcast, we hear about a new campaign called New Routes Home. It is a campaign for the rights for all people with disabilities to have their say in where they want to live and who they live with. So we spoke with Alastair Minty.
So Alastair, first of all tell us a bit about the New Routes Home.
Alastair:	Yeah, so New Routes Home is kind of … it’s kind of like a movement – it’s a collaboration of different people who are interested in not just complaining about how bad things are for some people who are either stuck in hospital because of their disability and because they can’t find somebody to support them, or either an out of area placement, or they’re at risk of losing their tenancy because folk are struggling.</description>
