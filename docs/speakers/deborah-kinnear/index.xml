      <description>Michael: On this podcast, I was speaking to Dr Deborah Kinnear from the Scottish Learning Disability Observatory. I was asking her about the new campaign; This is Me 22. But first of all, I wanted to find out more about what is the Scottish Learning Disability Observatory.
Deborah, before we begin speaking about This is Me 22, can you tell us a wee bit about what is the Scottish Learning Disability Observatory?</description>
