C OK, good morning, everyone. Thanks for attending this meeting of the Permanence Panel. First item on the agenda this morning is Douglas Jones, a nine-month-old child, and we have Jean, Douglas&amp;rsquo;s social worker, attending. I think it might be useful first just to do a quick roundtable of introductions. I think, Jean, you&amp;rsquo;ve been before, but there might be one or two people who weren&amp;rsquo;t on the previous panel.</description>

C Moving on to Mum&amp;rsquo;s view in terms of the permanent plan, Jean. What is Lauren currently saying about the plans for permanence for Douglas?
J Lauren&amp;rsquo;s got a foot in two camps, really, is the only way to say it. She is currently very clear that she would contest adoption for Douglas on one hand, but then on the other, she is supporting and preparing information for his future reference.</description>
