DN Dorothy Neriah
Dorothy Neriah is a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh who is conducting research on rethinking how we understand, evaluate and undertake foster carer recruitment. Michelle from Iriss had a conversation with her about how she came to focus on this topic, current practice in foster care recruitment and the benefits of rethinking the approach.
MD I&amp;rsquo;m here with Dorothy Neriah, who is a PhD student here at the University of Edinburgh, and your focus is foster care and kinship care and at the moment you&amp;rsquo;re doing a bit of research around rethinking how we understand, evaluate and undertake foster carer recruitment.</description>
