      <description>Kerry: Today is about exploring positive engagement with Scotland’s gypsy travellers and the role rural social work has in challenging the othering of these communities. This session is going to be looking at terminology, historical understanding and the relationship between social work and gypsy traveller communities. We’re hoping it’s going to challenge some of the preconceptions around gypsy travellers that exist and it’s going to introduce solution focused approaches to positive engagement and bring in and reflect on the lived experience of the community and look at inclusive practice.</description>
