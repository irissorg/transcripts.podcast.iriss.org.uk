      <description>NJ - Nico Juetten
Child care and protection research collection. Talk by Nico Juetten, recorded 6th January 2012
NJ The role of the (&amp;hellip; unclear) Office is to promote and safeguard the rights of children and young people, with particular regard to the United Nation&amp;rsquo;s Convention on Rights of the Child or UNCRC for short. The UK ratified the UNCRC in 1991 and so committed itself to bring in all laws, policies and practices in line with the Convention, and the Office&amp;rsquo;s remit covers children up to the age of 18 or 21 if they have been in the care system at any point.</description>
