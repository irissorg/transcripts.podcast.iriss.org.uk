DF - David Ferguson
On this next podcast for Iriss, I went to speak to David Ferguson. David is one of the executive Directors at The Observatory for Sport in Scotland. They do a lot of research into sport and disability sport in Scotland.
MM So, David can you tell us a bit about your work, just give us an overview of what you do?
DF Yes Michael, The Observatory for Sport in Scotland was started in 2016 in response to the decline in sport participation.</description>
