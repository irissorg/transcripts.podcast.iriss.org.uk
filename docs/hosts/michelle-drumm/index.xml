MD And from a social work perspective then, what is the significance of social pedagogy really?
MS For me some of the significance is it&amp;rsquo;s link back to some of the earlier ideas of Scottish social work, in particular Kilbrandon&amp;rsquo;s idea of social education and Cole Brandon thought of social education as education in it&amp;rsquo;s widest sense to work with individuals families and communities and if you think of the idea of social pedagogy then that is described as education in it&amp;rsquo;s broadest sense as well so, there are obvious sort of linkages.</description>

DS This exhibition is one of a series of events that we are organising for practitioners and general public policymakers, through a knowledge exchange programme of activities funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The exhibition is an interactive, very visual child centred model of thinking about a topic which is often quite controversial and a lot of people will have different opinions on, bringing together people who are migrants, non-migrants, people who have positive or less positive views on migration, perhaps challenging stereo types that people might have about what migrants are like and what experiences of migration are, what are peoples reasons for migrating.</description>
