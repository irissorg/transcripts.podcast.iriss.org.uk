      <description>Kerry: So welcome everybody and thanks for joining us for this, another session in our rural social work forum series. So, today our focus is on rural lives, understanding financial wellbeing and vulnerability in Scotland and I’m delighted to have three of the four authors of the Rural Lives report with us today. So, Dr Jayne Glass, Professor Mark Shucksmith and Polly Chapman, so, thank you all for coming. So, the Rural Lives report which was published earlier this year; in March I believe, provides valuable insight into the vulnerabilities of people living in rural communities and challenges the dominant narratives which often see poverty as an urban only issue.</description>

      <description>Kerry: It’s my great pleasure to introduce our speaker today, Iain Ramsay from the Office of the Chief Social Work Advisor. So, Iain became a professional advisor to government but before that he was Chief Social Work Officer in Aberdeenshire with experience across the Grampian area. He also chaired Social Work Scotland’s Resource Committee which included all 32 local authorities. So, that’s just to impress that he understands how remote and rural practice is different; the challenges, the opportunities and the strengths that it has.</description>

      <description>Kerry: Today is about exploring positive engagement with Scotland’s gypsy travellers and the role rural social work has in challenging the othering of these communities. This session is going to be looking at terminology, historical understanding and the relationship between social work and gypsy traveller communities. We’re hoping it’s going to challenge some of the preconceptions around gypsy travellers that exist and it’s going to introduce solution focused approaches to positive engagement and bring in and reflect on the lived experience of the community and look at inclusive practice.</description>
