DJ - Dan Johnson
Dan Johnson, Clinical Director at Kibble, interviews Neil MacMillan: an Executive Director at Kibble on the topic of moral distress in residential childcare. The conversation defines the concept, provides examples of it and suggestions for how to support workers who experience moral distress. More broadly it explores the impact of the system and the practice of residential childcare.
NM Welcome, I’m Neil MacMillan, I’m an Executive Director at Kibble School in Paisley, in Scotland and I’m joined today by Dan Johnson: who some of you may know from last year in New Orleans, who presented ACRC conference on trauma informed care in early years.</description>
