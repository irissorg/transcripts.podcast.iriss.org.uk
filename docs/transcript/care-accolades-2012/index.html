<p>MD The ninth Care Accolades was held at the Perth Concert Hall on Friday 22nd June 2012. The Care Accolades recognise the excellent and innovative work that social service organisations and their workers do, and provides an opportunity for these organisations to celebrate project and team successes. It was attended by the Minister for Children and Young People, Aileen Campbell, and chaired by Garry Coutts, Convenor of the SSSC, and Anna Fowlie, Chief Executive of the SSSC. The 10 categories of award included Investing in the Workforce, Developing Practice, Working Better, Working Together, Working with Local Communities, Innovation and Redesign, Children and Young People, Adults and Older People and Personalisation. There was also a &lsquo;One to Watch&rsquo; Award for both Children and Young People and Adults and Older People and a Chair&rsquo;s Award to bring the ceremony to a close. Before the award ceremony got underway, Iriss.fm spoke to Gary Coutts, chair of the judging panel and Convenor of the SSSC. He told us a bit about the origins and meaning of the Care Accolades and their importance to the social care sector.</p>

<p>MD This is Iriss.fm. Today we are at the Perth Concert Hall to celebrate the Care Accolades 2012. Speaking to me now is Gary Coutts, Convenor of the SSSC. Gary, are you excited about today?</p>

<p>GC I am just absolutely &hellip; I always love this - it&rsquo;s one of my favourite days of the year. It&rsquo;s such a happy event, seeing so many people who have done so much hard work to produce brilliant services that are helping thousands of folk across Scotland. It&rsquo;s a great event.</p>

<p>MD Can you tell me a little bit about the origins of the Care Accolades?</p>

<p>GC I think it&rsquo;s quite simple, that we have always, as an organisation, wanted to promote the very best in social care. We want the world to recognise the fantastic work that our workforce does - so having a celebration like this, an Awards event, is a great way of doing it. Nothing complex, it&rsquo;s as simple as that - we just want to celebrate the best of social care.</p>

<p>MD Excellent, how long have the Care Accolades been running?</p>

<p>GC This is our 9th year, so we will be celebrating our 10th year next year, so if you are involved in a project, think about your application now and you could be along at our 10th Anniversary Awards Ceremony at this time next year.</p>

<p>MD Can you just tell me a little bit about the importance of the Care Accolades in terms of social care generally?</p>

<p>GC I think the Care Accolades is particularly important for social care, because for an awful lot of the population, social care is almost a wee bit hidden away - it&rsquo;s something that happens in the shadows a bit, it&rsquo;s not like health services, it&rsquo;s not like education. It can be sometimes a little bit of a mystery to people - and I think that it&rsquo;s really, really important that we go out of our way to say how important social care is to the whole of the population. So I am delighted that we have got these here today, and the more people that know about them, the better. The more people that realise the impact that social care has on the whole of society, the better that we will be supported and be able to go on and develop better projects and do more work in the future.</p>

<p>MD After the ceremony, Lisa Curtis, the Director of Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability and a member of the judging panel also offered her thoughts on the day.</p>

<p>MD I am here with Lisa Curtis from SCLD, the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, at the Care Accolades 2012. Lisa, how does it feel to be here today?</p>

<p>LC Oh well it&rsquo;s really exciting. I mean I thought that judging just 2 of the awards we had seen a wide range, but now I have seen the whole number of awards that have been here today - I have just been astonished actually, and so many people doing above and beyond their job, totally committed to what they are doing, working in teams, working in partnership. I thought I knew the sector, but actually I have been really taken by surprise today.</p>

<p>MD Tell me a little bit about the process of entering the Care Accolades.</p>

<p>LC I think people have worked very hard on their applications because they have to evidence what they are doing, they have to think about the criteria, and then they have to describe what they are doing in a way that is going to convince the judges that they are not just doing the routine, but doing something really special. So seeing them go through the whole process, reading their awards and then putting their presentations together - and some of them were really innovative. One of them actually did a fashion show for their presentation which was just fantastic.</p>

<p>MD It was really great. And I suppose as such, every project is a winner today, and it&rsquo;s really all about participating. But what is it in particular projects that gives them the edge over others?</p>

<p>LC That&rsquo;s a really interesting question. I think that the edge comes, particularly when you see people and you realise that what they have put in the application is actually just the tip of the iceberg - and that actually underneath that is really solid work. So that means that they are able to &hellip; they know why they are doing it, they know and are able to show what the outcomes are, and you see it when you realise that somebody is able to tell a story that really, really hangs together, and what that story is about is where it makes a difference to people in their lives.</p>

<p>MD And was there a highlight for you today?</p>

<p>LC There were many highlights &hellip; oh goodness, it&rsquo;s really hard to pick one - it&rsquo;s like being on the judging panel all over again. I think for me the highlight is still the award that I was lucky enough to give out which was the Personalisation Award, which went to Nova by Penumbra. And you really see the future of services there because it wasn&rsquo;t about a service - it was about how individuals want to live their lives and how services change to give them that. So that was the highlight for me. And my colleague, Lindsey, thinks they should rename themselves SuperNova from now on.</p>

<p>MD SuperNova, that would be apt alright. Lisa Curtis from SCLD, thank you for talking to us today.</p>

<p>MD The first award of the ceremony, Investing in the Workforce Developing Practice, had 3 finalists. This category was all about demonstrating leadership and developing skills and practice in social care. We spoke to Doug Fairweather and Trisha Lowe from Angus Council who are winners of this award for the Learning Disability SVQ Programme.</p>

<p>MD How do you feel having won this award?</p>

<p>TL Fantastic.</p>

<p>DF Absolutely delighted.</p>

<p>TL The project is about getting staff qualified for their SVQ&rsquo;s so that they can register with the Scottish Social Services Council when the registration opens for them.</p>

<p>DF It&rsquo;s a large project - we work in partnership between &hellip; within Angus Council and also with the local college, but we also very much invest in our staff and work with our staff teams - so that is with over the Learning Disability Services.</p>

<p>MD And did you find there were any challenges in partnership working?</p>

<p>TL The challenge is trying to make the resources go further - and this is why we have developed this project, because we have started using people within each of the units so that they can do peer assessment and get their peers qualified, and we involve the service users in that as well.</p>

<p>MD Have the service users really embraced this?</p>

<p>TL The service users are very much leading it, along with myself and Trish, and have really taken ownership on this and really support staff in getting the qualification. Of course by doing that, it gives us a better &hellip; a more qualified staff workforce. So the benefits are great.</p>

<p>MD Well thank you both for speaking to me today, and well done again.</p>

<p>MD The Working Better, Working Together Award focus on evidence of collaborative practice which is making a difference. We spoke to Maureen O&rsquo;Neill from the Edinburgh Integrated Support Partnership for the City of Edinburgh Council, one of the finalists in this category.</p>

<p>MD Maureen, how does it feel to be shortlisted today for an award in the Working Better, Working Together category?</p>

<p>MO Well I think I can honestly say, on behalf of the City of Edinburgh Council and all the partners involved, we are absolutely ecstatic about it for being recognised for all the hard effort all our staff has put into the service.</p>

<p>MD And can you tell me a little bit about the project itself?</p>

<p>MO The project was the sort of innovation of the City of Edinburgh Council to bring together the private sector, the charities and obviously the local authority itself to provide a service for the most vulnerable children in the community, young people in the community. These are young people that have come from not particularly great backgrounds, they are in and out of trouble with the law, they don&rsquo;t go into full time education - and we are really there to basically prevent them from going into the next step which is secure care. And the service has been highly successful in putting young people back into full time education, into apprenticeships, back into school and placing them back with their families where they belong basically.</p>

<p>MD What was the key to the success of the actual project?</p>

<p>MO I think &hellip; we looked at all the statistics, we analysed everything, but I think when a young person told us that the service had saved his life was the most powerful feedback that we could get as a project - and that means that we not only saved his life, but his future family&rsquo;s life as well and prevented a further generation of young people going into secure care.</p>

<p>MD It sounds like an amazing project. Well best of luck today, thank you for speaking to me.</p>

<p>MO Thank you very much, I appreciate your time, thank you.</p>

<p>MD The finalists of the Working with Local Communities award were Speak 4 Yourself by ENABLE Scotland and Ycommunity by Ypeople. This category focused on teams that are changing things for the better and delivering sustainable improvements in their wider communities. Here is what ENABLE Scotland and Ypeople had to say. Maria McKay, Ypeople.</p>

<p>MD How does it feel to be a winner of Care Accolades 2012?</p>

<p>MM It is very difficult to describe how it feels. I know how absolutely elated I feel on behalf of our organisation. But I think one of the things that makes me feel even more elated is on behalf of the service users, some of whom are with us today, and all the service users, the ladies who are with us today are asylum seekers in Glasgow, and some of them arrived in this country seeking asylum and they have never been out of Glasgow before. So this whole experience has been absolutely fantastic for them, and to win the award has just really been the kind of exceptional part of it.</p>

<p>MD Yes, it&rsquo;s a big celebration for you all today.</p>

<p>MM Yes, yes.</p>

<p>MD Can you just give me a little bit more detail on the project?</p>

<p>MM It&rsquo;s called Ycommunity and it&rsquo;s basically &hellip; it&rsquo;s a service that we at Ypeople provide to asylum seekers and refugees living in Glasgow. We do it through our charitable funding for people who really don&rsquo;t have any family, any friends, any connections - so we help people to get to know each other, to socialise with each other, we provide internet access for people so that when they arrive with us they can contact their families where they have come from, let them know they are safe, keep in touch with them. We have a very good arrangement with Costco in Glasgow - they give us lots of food and we provide the service users with food because they receive a small allowance - some of them don&rsquo;t receive any allowance at all. But I mean they are certainly very much kind of literally on the breadline in terms of any income. They are not allowed to work. So anything that we can do that really eases the challenges that they face in their day to day lives comes within Ycommunity. And we provide free food, free clothing, we make space available for meetings, for English language classes. Other organisations come in as well and provide services to the service users within Ycommunity. So I mean it really is just a very kind of multi-cultural environment in which whatever challenges people are presented with, if we can do something to try and help it from a social perspective, then we will try and do that.</p>

<p>MD That&rsquo;s great Maria, well thank you for talking to me. I&rsquo;ll let you go and get your photograph taken now, and congratulations again.</p>

<p>MM That&rsquo;s lovely.</p>

<p>MD ENABLE Scotland - I am delighted to be here with Mhairi Buttle, Ashleigh Ryan, Kenneth McGowan from ENABLE Scotland who have been involved in the Speak 4 Yourself project. How does it feel to be shortlisted for the award today?</p>

<p>MB It&rsquo;s a real honour to be shortlisted for the award - as the coordinator it is really good to bring the young people with us as well to show off what they have done, and they have been really involved in all of the awards, coming through Dundee to do the judge&rsquo;s panel and everything as well. So it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>

<p>MD Can you tell me a little bit about the project?</p>

<p>KM The project is basically to help young people get more confidence and realise they can do more things than they think they can. And with the help of Ashley and as volunteers, they tend to talk to us a lot more and they tend to like us and come to us for support if they need any.</p>

<p>MD What was the key to the success of the project?</p>

<p>AR Our project is about bringing young people, with and without learning disabilities, together, and the key to the project is understanding that these young people want to be friends anyway and it&rsquo;s just about giving them an opportunity to meet people they wouldn&rsquo;t normally get to meet. So it is about bringing people together and understanding everyone else&rsquo;s differences and how that brings everyone together. So it is all about friendship, helping them build their confidence - but they do that together, which is ultimately what it is all about.</p>

<p>MD Brilliant, and was there any major kind of highlight or key learning from working on the project?</p>

<p>MB Major highlights tend to be we run activities all through Easter and we are going to do the same for the summer. And it&rsquo;s about giving the young people a chance to get out and about in their local community and show them to be givers and not just takers, and really involving themselves in the local community - because in West Dunbartonshire there is not an awful lot to do sometimes. So it&rsquo;s about finding the things that are there and showing the community that these young people are givers.</p>

<p>MD Kenneth, can I just ask you - have you met many other young people through this project?</p>

<p>KM Yes, I have, I have become friends with most of the young people that have come to the group, and they have become friends with me, and we talk, we have exchanged numbers, we have done &hellip; we have actually become very strong friends I would say.</p>

<p>MD That&rsquo;s excellent - sounds like a really successful project. Well best of luck today.</p>

<p>MB Thank you.</p>

<p>MD I hope it goes well for you.</p>

<p>MD In the Children and Young People category we again heard from ENABLE Scotland and their ENABLE Link project. This award was looking for organisations to demonstrate creative services that make a real difference to children and their wellbeing and learning. Karen Maley and Kirsty Soutar spoke to us about the project.</p>

<p>MD How does it feel to be shortlisted for an award today?</p>

<p>KMA Absolutely fantastic - all the young people have put in so much effort over the last few years, and it&rsquo;s just really great to get to this stage in the competition. And no matter who wins today, it will just be really exciting for everybody involved.</p>

<p>MD And Kirsty, how do you feel?</p>

<p>KS I never thought I would be at the awards. I think it will be an amazing day, so thank you.</p>

<p>MD Brilliant, and can you tell me a little bit about the ENABLE Link project?</p>

<p>KMA The ENABLE Link project - the basis for it is friendship. It&rsquo;s about supporting young people with learning disabilities to increase their social circles, to increase their friendship circles and basically to go out and have fun, the same as every other teenager does. And yes, it has been really successful and there is a lot of people have made new friends and have bigger friendship circles.</p>

<p>MD And what do you think is the key to the success of the project?</p>

<p>KMA It&rsquo;s basically about having fun, and everyone realising that whether you have a learning disability or not, we have the same ideas that everybody just wants to go out and have fun, be relaxed and be open minded.</p>

<p>MD And Kirsty, how have you experienced the project?</p>

<p>KS Well I love this project because for my end of school, leaving high school, I go to Lenzie Academy and I am going to the USA, and they are wanting me to take two SLA&rsquo;s, and Karen has enrolled a peer supporter which is my friend Sarah who is 18. So she can come with me and help me do stuff.</p>

<p>MD Well that sounds really exciting. Best of luck with that.</p>

<p>KS Thanks.</p>

<p>MD Thank you both for speaking to me today.</p>

<p>MD The Adults and Older People award finalists included the Women&rsquo;s Support Service by West Dunbartonshire Council, Facing Dementia Together by Alzheimer Scotland and Positive Steps by South Ayrshire Council. We spoke to Grace McVeigh from the Women&rsquo;s Support Service project, winner of this award.</p>

<p>MD Grace, how does it feel to be a winner today?</p>

<p>GM Oh we are absolutely delighted, we are just blown away - we think it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>MD Yes, it&rsquo;s a really interesting project. Do you mind just telling me a little bit about it?</p>

<p>GM Yes, we work with women who have experienced domestic abuse - but we work within a criminal justice context, which means that we proactively contact women when the incident is coming to court and we also work with female offenders who have experienced any form of gender based violence, including commercial sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>MD Are there other support organisations involved?</p>

<p>GM We work very closely with the Police - we get all the incidents for the whole of West Dunbartonshire as the incident occurs - and it means that we can then look to those high risk cases and offer women a service immediately following any incident of domestic abuse. We also work with the Criminal Justice Service, which means that they give us referrals for any woman where they are working with the perpetrator and for female offenders when the woman discloses that she has been the victim of abuse. We probably offer a service to about 80 women a year. There are 2 of us that provide the service, and I think getting this accolade as well just shows that even such a small service can demonstrate that we make a big difference.</p>

<p>MD Absolutely, has there been any challenges involved?</p>

<p>GM The challenge always is to, I suppose, challenge men&rsquo;s abusive behaviour, and that is why we work to closely with the Criminal Justice Team, because they realise that us working with the women, keeping women safer, means that they can provide a more robust service in terms of challenging men&rsquo;s abusive behaviour.</p>

<p>MD Well Grace, thank you very much for speaking to me today and well done again on winning your award.</p>

<p>MD We also had a conversation with Heather, a representative of NHS Ayrshire, one of the partners on the Positive Steps project by South Ayrshire Council.</p>

<p>MD Heather, how does it feel to be shortlisted today for an award?</p>

<p>H We are absolutely delighted. We just feel that it&rsquo;s a real accolade just to be here. This is a partnership project - I am actually from the NHS and I have partnered up with South Ayrshire Council to get involved in this project which is aimed to prevent falls within the sheltered housing sector. And our project been sort of a step by step process - starting off by putting in training to get wardens up to speed as Falls Champions, and then also linking with a community rehab team, so that we can refer people at risk of falling for early intervention and assessment. And the project has worked exceptionally well - and we have added something which is quite novel and unique. Once the wardens felt like Falls Champions, they wanted to enable the residents to practice in terms of self-management. So once they were taught, they wanted to share that knowledge with the residents. And we have developed a wonderful little learning package that is a little product called Positive Steps, and it involves working with the residents in a sort of nice, interactive learning environment, with slides all about the positive messages to take to avoid falls. These are hand-held slides like &ldquo;look after your feet&rdquo;, &ldquo;keep active&rdquo;, &ldquo;eat a healthy diet&rdquo; - all the things that help you to self-manage and prevent falls, which have a huge expensive cost to both health and social care, and also a human cost. Once you have fallen and if you have broken a hip, it&rsquo;s quite a devastating thing to happen, and we really want to avoid that and keep people well and healthy into their old age.</p>

<p>MD Were there any challenges with the partnership working?</p>

<p>H Well there are always challenges when new people get together and you have got different perspectives. But when you focus on improving people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing, and your residents - whether we want to call them patients or clients or service users, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. If you have got that joint focus and you are all working together, you can overcome any barriers that come your way.</p>

<p>MD Well best of luck today Heather, thanks for speaking to me.</p>

<p>MD At last year&rsquo;s Care Accolades 2011, Iriss sponsored the Innovation and Redesign Award, and award introduced for teams, partnerships or organisations to demonstrate how they can solve a problem in a new way through innovative service redesign or using new technology. Iriss was delighted to once again by sponsoring the award this year. The finalists included Clothesline Project by Gowrie Care, Equipu Stairlifts Project by Equipu Partnership and bespoken by The Blackwood Foundation. We spoke to David Jarrold from The Blackwood Foundation - winner of the Innovation and Redesign Award 2012 for bespoken, a social networking website.</p>

<p>MD Congratulations on being nominated in the Innovation and Design Award, that is the one Iriss is sponsoring - we are very delighted to do that. How does it feel to be nominated in this category</p>

<p>DJ We are absolutely delighted. I mean bespoken as a project has really just been on the go for under a year, so to get this level of recognition this early on is absolutely fantastic.</p>

<p>MD And can you tell me a little bit about the project?</p>

<p>DJ Absolutely - it grew out of a whole series of workshops that we did going around the country last year, talking to people about design, technology and innovation and what we could do to try and drive change and make a difference. And a number of things came out of that, but the key thing was that people are the absolute experts in independent living and promoting their own independence and finding solutions. But what we don&rsquo;t do is capture and share that knowledge and that expertise and insight. So that is what bespoken does - it&rsquo;s effectively an online community for people to come together and share their experiences and their tips and their recommendations with each other. So you kind of crowd-source solutions for their own independence and for their own circumstances. And then the next stage for us is to link those people with designers and developers and technology companies, and so they are in the driving seat for innovation and improvement going forward.</p>

<p>MD Sounds really great - has it been embraced well by the community?</p>

<p>DJ Very much so - although the majority of the members on bespoken are UK &hellip; Scotland and UK based, we have got a smattering or members from across the world - and as soon as you do something in the digital space, there is no geographic boundaries. So we have been pretty much bowled over by the level of response that we have had, both in the UK and further afield, and it&rsquo;s really kind of whetted our appetite to push this further in the future.</p>

<p>MD And has there been challenges, with the fact that it&rsquo;s an online, it&rsquo;s a website?</p>

<p>DJ There have, and there is a challenge that not everybody is online themselves. But our kind of research led us to the decision that there is no on that is more than one stage removed - whether it is friends or family or a support worker - there is always &hellip; there is a potential for everyone to be connected onto the internet and to make use of the community that is there. So that is why we went down this road.</p>

<p>MD Any key learning or a highlight of the project?</p>

<p>DJ Yes, there is always more work than you expect! We felt &hellip; we knew there was a need for this, I mean having gone out and done the leg work. And it was all based on, as I say, primary research, talking to people, listening to people and trying to put in place what they needed. But even doing that, just putting a website together and putting this online community together isn&rsquo;t enough - there is a hell of a lot of work in getting out there and promoting it and explaining to people what it is for and how it can be used. And that is the stage we are at just now - which is why this is a fantastic opportunity for us just to share the knowledge of the project to a wider audience.</p>

<p>MD Great stuff. That was David Jarrold talking about the project &lsquo;bespoken&rsquo;.</p>

<p>MD The Personalisation Award went to the Nova Project by Penumbra. Nigel Henderson, Jane Cumming and Leah Ford told us more about it.</p>

<p>MD How do you feel about being shortlisted for this award?</p>

<p>NH We are very excited actually. Nova is a new set of services for us. We have a number of them across the country, so we are really excited and we have a one in three chance, so we can&rsquo;t wait to find out.</p>

<p>MD Yes, and best of luck with that. Can you tell me a little bit about the project and the origins of it?</p>

<p>JC I think the Nova Project, the concept came about a few years ago when we were conscious of the fact that many services still required people to visit buildings and I guess inevitably people were then shaped by what happens within the building, and it wasn&rsquo;t something where the service was designed around the person and what it was that was going to be suitable and useful for them. So we wanted something that was more flexible and more focused on actually moving in the direction that the person wanted to go, that gave flexible support, I suppose, to the person. So that&rsquo;s &hellip; so we started in a small way in the north of Aberdeenshire, and it&rsquo;s just &hellip; as we have learned, the concept has grown and we are now delighted that we have 6 Nova projects in Scotland and we are supporting over 500 people at the minute through Nova projects. And we are very pleased, I think that it is now beginning to show good evidence of how successful it is in terms of delivering a good service to people and a service that is relevant for people in terms of what they want.</p>

<p>MD What do you think are the challenges with personalisation?</p>

<p>JC Well I think it is difficult to &hellip; I mean the process of change is always difficult, when people have been used to things being done in a particular way. I think it is difficult &hellip; I mean as I said, a Nova project has to be flexible - but delivering flexibility within a service in and of itself is different because people want different things at different times, and being able to plan a service round that way. And I think, you know, there is a safety and a security around something that is physical, you know, in a way that a building is, and I think people are maybe a bit unsure, a bit more uncertain about what is actually available through something like a Nova project. So, you know, in order to kind of convince people that this can work for anybody, it doesn&rsquo;t matter really your circumstances - because it is built round your needs, it can work for anybody. So it has been quite a challenge, I think, persuading people that that can be the case. But the more projects that we have and the more that people hear about it and see it working for people, then I think the more &hellip; it&rsquo;s easier for us to say, you know, look, this is actually working.</p>

<p>MD Thanks Jane. Leah, what part did you play in Nova?</p>

<p>LF I have been using the service now for just over a year, and I have been supported and helped to move on using various tools and one to one support. And I was in a very dark place, and I have now overcome a lot of difficulties, and I have come a long way.</p>

<p>MD Excellent, well thank you all for speaking to me today and best of luck.</p>

<p>MD The team from C-Change, a finalist in the Personalisation category, also spoke to us about their initiative.</p>

<p>C-Change We won, we won, yes, we won, yes we definitely won.</p>

<p>MD Well we definitely hope you do win. I am here right now with the C-Change project, nominated in the Personalisation category. So how do you feel to be shortlisted for this award today?</p>

<p>C-Change Absolutely delighted to be shortlisted. We were really amazed, because our Dates &lsquo;n&rsquo; Mates project were a finalist last year, so we didn&rsquo;t expect to be nominated and to be at the ceremony again this year, so we are absolutely delighted.</p>

<p>MD And can you tell me a little bit about the project?</p>

<p>C-Change C-Change is a person centred organisation based in Glasgow, and we work around Glasgow and North Lanarkshire. We work with people on an individual basis, using individual service funds to help them achieve their outcomes.</p>

<p>MD And what do you think as the key success of the project?</p>

<p>C-Change I think that C-Change has &hellip; the kind of proof is in the pudding, if you like. C-Change does and is able to evidence quite a strong impact on people&rsquo;s lives in the way that they work with them, to help them plan what it is that they are wanting to achieve, and to help them use their own individual resource to make those achievements happen.</p>

<p>MD The One to Watch Award for Adults and Older People went to Carr Gomm. Using technology to revolution support. Andrew Thomson, the project lead, had this to say about it.</p>

<p>MD Andrew, how does it feel to be a winner today at the Care Accolades?</p>

<p>AT Oh we are absolutely delighted today to be a winner at the Care Accolades. This is the very first time we have entered, and so to win is just quite overwhelming really, it&rsquo;s excellent.</p>

<p>MD Excellent, it&rsquo;s been a good day. Can you tell me a little bit about the actual project itself?</p>

<p>AT Sure, our project is a bespoke piece of software that allows people to manage their own social care - from their budget, what they spend, how much they have, keeping in control of that, requesting workers at a certain time and day, especially which worker you want, and then being able to measure your outcomes, about how your social care is working for you and what difference it is making in your life. So all of that comes together in our piece of software that can work on a tablet pc, a laptop, a desktop, any kind of smartphone.</p>

<p>MD And are you finding that people are generally very positive around this piece of technology?</p>

<p>AT Well we expected quite positive outcomes, but really the impact has been overwhelming. The difference that this is making in people&rsquo;s lives is just absolutely incredible and we really hope to be able to work with many other people, all across Scotland, even the world, to share this technology.</p>

<p>MD And were there any challenges in sort of developing this project?</p>

<p>AT Well what we have done really does revolutionise social care, and so there are challenges that come with that - operational challenges certainly, the excitement and the challenge that comes with that, with trying to keep your excitement levels, your ideas in check, to build something that works within a certain scope, rather than letting your ideas run away with you.</p>

<p>MD Great, great, well Andrew, thank you very much for talking to us today at Iriss.fm, and well done again.</p>

<p>AT Thank you.</p>

<p>MD To round of a very positive and uplifting afternoon, Iriss.fm spoke to Lindsay Kinloch of the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability who gave her take on the day and what she was particularly impressed with.</p>

<p>MD Lindsay, did you enjoy the ceremony today?</p>

<p>LK I thought it was fantastic - the venue is really good and everyone seemed to be enjoying it. I thought that the people didn&rsquo;t &hellip; the people that didn&rsquo;t win still felt that they had.</p>

<p>MD And do you think it was a nice opportunity for people to celebrate some of the good things that are happening in social care?</p>

<p>LK I think it is. It is important to celebrate achievements, and particularly around new projects that organisations have come up with.</p>

<p>MD And which project did you find particularly interesting today?</p>

<p>LK I quite liked the One to Watch, the Children and Young People, because I thought that the last one &hellip; the last project at the end, it&rsquo;s more &hellip; it&rsquo;s personally more up my street.</p>

<p>MD So it&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s something that you actually identify with more.</p>

<p>LK Yes.</p>

<p>MD Excellent.</p>

<p>LK It&rsquo;s because particularly I did photography at school, and I think it is good that people are learning about that.</p>

<p>MD Yes, so some of the more creative projects might have appealed to you a bit more?</p>

<p>LK Yes, because I am particularly creative myself, so &hellip;</p>

<p>MD Great stuff, great stuff. Well Lindsay, thank you very much speaking to us today at the Care Accolades.</p>
