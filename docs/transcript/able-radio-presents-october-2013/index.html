        <p>MM - Michael McEwan</p>
<p>In this episode, guest presenter, Michael McEwan from Able Radio, gives us the latest roundup of news and events for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>MM Hello, welcome to Iriss.fm and welcome to this podcast. Coming up on this months podcast we will tell you a bit about a few AGM&rsquo;s taking place - Enable Scotland, Downs Syndrome Scotland, and we will tell you a bit about the SCLD, the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disabilities we have news of events taking place later in November. We will also tell you a bit about Trendspotting, a new project undertaken by the Social Ideas Factory.</p>
<p>First up this month, we will start by telling you about a football team for people with a disability and mental health. If you&rsquo;ve fell away from football and you want to get fit again to play football, or just come and meet new pals, we are always looking for new players to take part. So why not email me if you would like to get involved? You can email michaelmcewan43 &hellip; that&rsquo;s the number 4 3, @gmail.com, that&rsquo;s <a href="mailto:michaelmcewan43@gmail.com">michaelmcewan43@gmail.com</a>. If you would like to come and take part in the football. We meet every Monday night at a primary school in Barrhead, called Carlibar School and it&rsquo;s £5 on the night, and it should be good fun. This football has been going since the beginning of the year and we are now up to 11 people, but we are looking to increase the numbers.</p>
<p>Next up this month we will tell you a bit about Trendspotting, a new community facilitated by Social Idea Factory, made up of people who require additional support needs with everyday living for individuals to share their experiences of health and social care. We will rely on people&rsquo;s views and ideas to shape better life. Basically what that means is Trendspotting is looking for a network of people with a learning disability, or mental health, to come together to have meetings to shape a better way of their life at the moment. They will speak about travel, they will speak about work and employment, money, using the internet, learning stuff, watching TV, shopping, love, relationships, health and wellbeing, care needs, driving, community, safety, hobbies and family and friends. This project is run by the Scottish Government and we are now looking for people to get involved. I am part of the network of people designing the course and now we are looking for a network, that could be you, that could be your pals, that could be your family to get involved with the project. All you have to do is, if you have got Facebook, you can like us on Facebook at Trendspotting, or you can email <a href="mailto:Trendspotting@gmail.com">Trendspotting@gmail.com</a>, so that&rsquo;s an exciting new project run by the Social Ideas Factory.</p>
<p>Next up this month, there&rsquo;s a lot of news to tell you. First up, we will you a bit about the AGM taking place in November. November is a busy time for disability organisations to have AGM&rsquo;s. First up, Downs Syndrome Scotland will be holding their AGM and Conference at the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld, on Saturday the 16th of November, between 9:15 to quarter past 4. The conference will include a morning and afternoon workshop. The key note speaker this year will be Peter Scott. Peter Scott is the Chief Executive of Enable Scotland and the Chair for the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disabilities. On the day they will have lunch, networking, and AGM, now the AGM is only for members only, and a question and answer panel. Their workshop this year at the conference will focus on IApps. If you want some information on the Downs Syndrome AGM taking place on the 16th of November, please go to dsscotland.org.uk, that&rsquo;s dsscotland.org.uk. Another AGM to tell you a bit about now is Enable Scotland AGM and Council meeting on the 2nd of November at the Stirling Management Centre at Stirling university Campus, from 9:30 to 2:00 o&rsquo;clock. To book for this event, people can contact Enable direct on the number, which is 0300 0200 101, or you can email <a href="mailto:enabledirect@enable.org.uk">enabledirect@enable.org.uk</a> that&rsquo;s <a href="mailto:enabledirect@enable.org.uk">enabledirect@enable.org.uk</a>. So that is Enable Scotland AGM and Council Meeting taking place on the 2nd of November at Stirling University.</p>
<p>All of the events to everything we have spoke about this month will appear on the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Last up, I will tell you a bit about our AGM, it&rsquo;s taking place on the 13th of &hellip; Wednesday the 13th of November at the Scottish Youth Theatre, ran by the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disabilities on welfare reform. Now, I got emailed a copy of the programme and it is full of events. On the day they will have master classes, keynote speakers, spotlights on and debates. Who should attend this event, Local Authorities, Health and Social Care Professionals, Carers and Families and people with Learning Disabilities, because at the end of the day it&rsquo;s important for, if it&rsquo;s going to affect people with Learning Disabilities, the Welfare Reform.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about that Welfare Reform debate, please go onto the SCLD website, that&rsquo;s the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disabilities website, at scld.org.uk that&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.scld.org.uk">www.scld.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p>My name has been Michael McEwan, thanks for listening to another broadcast from Iriss.fm. I will be back next month with some more news and events.</p>
