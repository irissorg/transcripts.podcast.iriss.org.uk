SM Hello and welcome to our discussion around the duty of candour, my name is Stuart Muirhead and I&amp;rsquo;m a project manager in Iriss. The thinking for this discussion came from being out about in the social services sector, over the last year and getting the feeling that the duty of candour provisions were something that were either well known, or known of and also something that was possibly causing some anxiety or confusion, either that or they weren&amp;rsquo;t on people&amp;rsquo;s radar at all.</description>

MS Yeah.
MD And from a social work perspective then, what is the significance of social pedagogy really?
MS For me some of the significance is it&amp;rsquo;s link back to some of the earlier ideas of Scottish social work, in particular Kilbrandon&amp;rsquo;s idea of social education and Cole Brandon thought of social education as education in it&amp;rsquo;s widest sense to work with individuals families and communities and if you think of the idea of social pedagogy then that is described as education in it&amp;rsquo;s broadest sense as well so, there are obvious sort of linkages.</description>

MM On this episode I went to hear about an organisation called Outside the Box, where I was talking to Jill Keegan, who is the Community Development Adviser. The first question I asked her was, tell us a bit about Outside the Box.
JK Outside the Box is a community development support organisation. So, we are an equalities charity and we are based in Glasgow, but we work right across Scotland and now have also some links with England and Wales, with one of the really big projects we run called Rural Wisdom.</description>

CT Thanks very much folks and it&amp;rsquo;s a privilege to be here at the first of these talking social work sessions and I certainly hope it&amp;rsquo;s something that will continue, it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to see such large numbers interested in something like this. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m here tonight is because a result of a commission from Iriss, I&amp;rsquo;ve written this, now it was a collaborative effort and in a sense the story of this publication which only came off the press yesterday is a bit like the history of community social work which is what I want to talk about tonight and that history over the last fifty years since the 68 Act.</description>

Jane So it&amp;rsquo;s really good to be here and excellent turn out I think we are going to rival the opening for the V &amp;amp; A and I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t realise there was quite so many social workers. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that in Dundee we have a very strong belief in the value of practitioner forum, that&amp;rsquo;s particularly important given the disperse nature of our workforce and when Alan was here as Director of social work, he worked hard to introduce support and embed the approach, but in truth I think like other areas we have struggled to retain the concept, we&amp;rsquo;ve found that our meetings were becoming poorly attended and actually there was a bit of a sense that they were turning into a meeting and greeting session.</description>

So just a little bit about my journey, who I am and how I ended up here and how I ended up talking about Gypsies and Travellers when I&amp;rsquo;m not myself a Gypsy or a Traveller, although I think there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of a connection through the Indian connection, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start with myself.</description>

Access Film Club is a monthly Autism-friendly screening that happens at Glasgow Film Theatre, and we began the journey in November 2014, and at the time we were working with a fantastic organisation called Scottish Autism, who helped us develop the film club into what we see today, and then last year we said goodbye to Scottish Autism and we continued working with the National Autistic Society Scotland, which has enabled us to continue running the monthly screenings.</description>

Int. Restorative justice is a process of dialogue between two parties. In the context of criminal justice social work this will be a victim or person harmed and an offender, one who has caused harm. Statutory criminal justice social work in Edinburgh is a service aimed to reducing reoffending and protecting the public through evidence based interventions. The development of a restorative justice service for those on statutory orders is a new and progressive approach to tackling reoffending.</description>

RF Well I faced quite a number of obstacles when I was young, my big one I would say, was when I actually started nursery school because I simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it, it was far too much for me, the playing and all that, with other children, just simply did not happen and I don&amp;rsquo;t really think you got much help back then when I started, I mean you are talking the late 1990s here, you didn&amp;rsquo;t really get much support.</description>

Our aim today is to consider opportunities to develop alternative approaches to short break provision but tap into the wider community resources.</description>

GG Well basically Limelight&amp;rsquo;s an organisation that supports disabled musicians and provides professional training and employment with the largest employer of disabled musicians in Scotland and within that remit we also roll out a youth&amp;rsquo;s programme to primary schools and to primary schools with Autism units, vision impairment units and hearing impairment units to encourage children to look at ways of developing skills in music and also drama but mainly music, and the reason for this is so that they can get transferrable skills that can lead to employment in other stratospheres of the, of the world basically.</description>

DW - Don Williamson
DW What is ISBA? Right ISBA stands for the International Short Break Association and it&amp;rsquo;s a worldwide initiative made up of a whole variety of different agencies and organisations who are all providing healthcare and respite services for families who are concerned or affected by disability. It began back in 1995 with a Conference in a place called Thunder Bay in Canada and the event was entitled Rendezvous for Respite and then we managed to bring together 300 people from 13 different countries, possibly the very first time that that&amp;rsquo;s ever happened that we&amp;rsquo;ve had such a large gathering of people with that shared sort of common interest in respite and then from there it evolved into a whole series of Conferences which happen every two years and they are hosted by different countries and Scotland this year is hosting the 10th event.</description>

AC - Aileen Campbell
DM Now if we are to make progress then it is absolutely critical that our sector has a positive relationship with our Government. Good legislation and policy is key to creating the conditions that are needed that will help us to develop the best provision that we can. I think in Scotland we are really fortunate in that we have a Government and we have a Parliament that goes to great lengths to be as open and as accessible as it can so that people really feel that they have the opportunity to engage directly with the key decisions that will affect their lives and there is a lot happening in Scotland at the moment concerning new Laws that will help to strengthen the support available to unpaid carers and to people that they care for.</description>

K Social Pedagogy is an approach to working with people which focusses on relationships. It encourages staff to think about how they can strengthen their relationships through spending quality time with somebody and jointly taking part in activities. It encourages them to reflect on their practise, to acknowledge where things didn&amp;rsquo;t work and to use that information not to blame themselves, but to try something different next time and to focus on how they can use their relationships with someone to help that person to learn and develop.</description>

Well it&amp;rsquo;s important to raise the issues of people with learning disabilities, raise issues and make people aware that there are issues, and give them a stronger voice in their community and society, at the end of the day, and hopefully we will break down barriers and give people an even bigger chance with a learning disability or mental health issues for that matter, to try and get into employment.</description>

How do we deal with trauma? Most of us have a reference point for what is &amp;lsquo;safe&amp;rsquo; which allows us to make sense of traumatic events (for example a car crash) and provides a framework to deal with it. Looked after or adoptive children often have no such reference point which makes it difficult for them and their parents to deal with trauma.</description>

JS I came here from the States, specifically from North Carolina, and I can talk like this all the live long day if it would amuse and please you, but it&amp;rsquo;s not actually how I talk, so I will just sort of go with what I know and lapse into it every once in a while if it would please you. But in North Carolina, I had the pleasure of being Chief Executive of an organisation which was called the North Carolina Child Advocacy Institute, and part of what we did was to create a coalition of organisations called, &amp;lsquo;the Covenant with North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s Children.</description>

GR Relationships Matter is a project run by Iriss, and we wanted to look specifically at difficulties that workers from a range of different services experience in terms of keeping in contact with young people who are leaving care.
We have read in the literature and we have spoken to workers and young people have brought it up, time and time again, that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of difficulties maintaining relationships that they would like to continue as they transition and become inter-dependent and are moving in and out of different communities.</description>

The routines and the rituals that surround food, shopping, preparing, cooking, serving, clearing up, are important parts of our lives, yet often we fail to recognise as symbolic or hidden meanings. The Food for Thought project grew out of research undertaken by the University of Stirling into the symbolic role of food in foster and residential childcare. The project has created a variety of tools and training materials which encourage reflection and strengthen the use of knowledge about food and looked after children.</description>

Recent policy and practice shifts towards personal outcomes present a number of opportunities and challenges for those who provide human services in Scotland. Carr Gomm, which describes itself as a person centred organisation that supports people to lead their lives safely and to do the things they want to do, has developed its own conversation based outcome measurement tool. Their system is designed to capture and track the personal outcomes of the people they support and link these to the wider local and national outcomes.</description>

MD On 27th March 2013, Iain Ferguson, Professor of Social Work and Social Policy at the University of the West of Scotland, gave an inaugural lecture entitled &amp;lsquo;A bed for the night? Austerity, social work and resistance&amp;rsquo;, which challenges the myth of welfare dependency used to justify attacks on some of the poorest sections of the community. He examines the impact of cuts on services on people&amp;rsquo;s lives, including the working poor, and argues that the crisis calls for a different kind of social work, drawing on the radical tradition and rooted in the collective experience of service users.</description>

Young people who are looked after at home or are under a Home Supervision requirement make up the largest proportion of young people who are looked after. They have the poorest educational outcomes compared to other groups, yet have been largely neglected by research. John Paul Fitzpatrick of CELCIS, the Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland, has studied this group as part of his PhD research.</description>

KE Taking The First Steps started from the idea that there had been relatively little work done in Scotland with children, young people and families, as well as with local authorities and provider organisations, so we were trying to work out ways that people could be involved in directing their own support. And Taking the First Steps was designed to help people go through the process of Self Direct Support in a way that was safe and not risky for anyone, for people themselves, for families and for local authorities.</description>

The exhibition is an interactive, very visual child centred model of thinking about a topic which is often quite controversial and a lot of people will have different opinions on, bringing together people who are migrants, non-migrants, people who have positive or less positive views on migration, perhaps challenging stereo types that people might have about what migrants are like and what experiences of migration are, what are peoples reasons for migrating.</description>

James Doleman started blogging during the Tommy Sheridan trial in 2006. At a seminar organised by Strathclyde University&amp;rsquo;s Centre for Law, Crime and Justice, James talked about why social media and criminal courts should be seen as an opportunity rather than a problem. The vast majority of court proceedings are not reported at all, and a great many are under-reported. Social media offers us a new set of media tools that can open up justice and enable citizens to take an active role in the world, going to court rooms or local Council meetings and telling people what is happening.</description>

An asset based approach means shifting the balance away from doing things to people in favour of doing things with people. Assets, or social assets, are things like personal skills, inner strength, knowledge and lived experiences - so things that people already possess that can be harnessed to help them deal with crisis, trauma or problems.</description>

Interviewees: Carron O&amp;rsquo;Byrne and Morag Dendy, North Lanarkshire Council and Gerry Kelly, In Control
MD We&amp;rsquo;ve really tried to put families at the centre and give people much more choice and control over the lives they want to live and the supports that they put around them, not necessarily traditional services within that, and helping people understand the individual budget that&amp;rsquo;s available to them makes such a big difference, but we are also clear that what works in adults in working out what budget is right, isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the same as what works for children and families, so the opportunity to test something out specifically around children and families is really exciting.</description>

Helen Whincup, teaching fellow at the University of Stirling, reflects on a qualitative study entitled &amp;lsquo;Involving Young People Messages from Research&amp;rsquo; which examines how young people feel involved or not in assessment and decision making. It was recorded at a Scottish Childcare Protection meeting on the 30th of April 2012.
HW This morning is thinking about some of the messages from research about what children have said about their feelings about being involved and I will also be drawing on the research that I have been doing.</description>

RI Thank you Sandy for talking to me today and congratulation on being Social Worker of the Year in Scotland.
SW Thanks very much.
RI What does it mean for you to receive this award?
SW Well I suppose I am still probably trying to come to terms with it - it was a bit of a shock at the time, but as I say, I feel quite comfortable with it now, I feel quite happy because I realise it&amp;rsquo;s more than just a personal award, it is a reflection on social work in general and my colleagues and everybody I have had contact with.</description>

Child care and protection research collection. Talk by Carol Comben recorded 17 March 2012
My name is Carol Comben. The focus of the study is the role of the palliative care social worker in safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children of adults who are receiving specialist palliative care. The background to this is that whilst there is a stress on the importance of the family in palliative care, reference in the literature generally refers to partners, adult relatives and carers.</description>

RE My background is as a residential social workers and I had went on to do my PhD looking at young people in residential care and how they formed friends and peer relationships. And as part of that I lived in a residential unit for a year to undertake the research - and one of the things that became very apparent as a kind of pseudo resident was the significance of food and how much of a part food played in the day to day life of both the children and of the adults.</description>

J Lauren&amp;rsquo;s got a foot in two camps, really, is the only way to say it. She is currently very clear that she would contest adoption for Douglas on one hand, but then on the other, she is supporting and preparing information for his future reference.</description>

Okay, so the study that I worked on is called &amp;lsquo;Growing Up In Scotland&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s a longitudinal study &amp;hellip; a longitudinal birth and child cohort study. So we are basically covering or tracking several groups of children from their early childhood, into sort of middle childhood, hopefully into adolescence and maybe beyond. It&amp;rsquo;s a study that is funded by Scottish government, funded by the Education Directorate, so a lot of what we do in the study is directed at producing evidence that can be used to inform policy making directly.</description>

Then we rolled out the next part of the journey which was called &amp;lsquo;Right Brilliant Things&amp;rsquo;, and this was focused on ensuring that we were asking children and young people not only about what they think should improve in the lives of children and young people, but actually what they themselves perceived as really important parts of their lives to celebrate - what they thought was happening really well for children and young people in Scotland.</description>

BA We see it everywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s all over this conference. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it mentioned many times today.
But what is it?
It&amp;rsquo;s simple. &amp;lsquo;Getting it Right for Every Child&amp;rsquo; is transformational change in the assessment, planning and delivery of services to Scotland&amp;rsquo;s children and families, probably unparalleled since the introduction of the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hearings System and care planning processes, thirty years ago.

      <description>DK - David Kinloch
DK Hi, my name is David. I am from Stirling.
I would like to welcome you to this Conference. I hope that you enjoy the day, and I hope that you get a lot out of all the things that are happening today.
We are here today to talk about Forgotten Citizens. People that were kept out of society and forgotten about. People that had no rights, people who had no voice, and people who had no choices.</description>
