ER - Evan Rae
MM Okay now on Iriss.fm we&amp;rsquo;re going to be continuing our series on support workers and we are going to be talking to Evan Rae about his work as a support worker. So first off Evan why did you want to get into this kind of work?
ER I think initially it&amp;rsquo;s always something that&amp;rsquo;s been a kind of an interest for me, working with folk who have a learning disability or extra support needs or something.</description>

GC - Greg Campbell
MM Ok, now on Iriss.fm we are going to be talking to Greg Campbell. Greg Campbell is a support worker. So, Greg, why did you want to get into this kind of work?
GC Well, I have always felt that I have been a very helpful and supportive person. I think that comes a lot from my family and the way I have been brought up, just a very caring and nurtured, supporting environment.</description>
