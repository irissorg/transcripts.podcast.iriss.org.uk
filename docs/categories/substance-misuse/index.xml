      <description>NF - Naimh Fitzgerald
The Evidence Exchange programme, an Alliance for Useful Evidence initiative, seeks to encourage the sharing and use of social policy evidence across the UK. One of the programme&amp;rsquo;s themes is the role of evidence in developing policy and interventions that reduce people&amp;rsquo;s risk of alcohol related harm, such as ABIs - Alcohol Brief Interventions. In this episode, Dr Naimh Fitzgerald discusses what is known about ABIs, how and where they work; her recent research on delivery of ABIs outside of primary healthcare, and pointers for practitioners.</description>

LH The research study that I would like to tell you about is called &amp;lsquo;Revealing Lives&amp;rsquo; - a qualitative study with children and young people affected by parental alcohol problems. This was a PhD study that I completed at the University of Edinburgh with Barnardo&amp;rsquo;s Childcare organisation, and I used to work for Barnardo&amp;rsquo;s as a researcher and this was a piece of work that was kind of developed along the way and in discussion with services.</description>
