      <description>Meylis: Hi, I’m Meylis from North Wales. I live here in Gwynedd and I’ve worked in Gwynedd for quite a few years. And currently I’m in a role across health and social care, leading a programme of change called the Community Transformation Programme. And one of the key things I’m working on and have been working on for a long time, is trying to change the way that we commission and deliver home care in Gwynedd.</description>

      <description>Kiana: My name is Kiana, Kiana Kalantar-Hormozi. I’m an artist, filmmaker and activist, and up until now I’m proud to have had many achievements. I’ve been nominated one of the 30, under-30, most inspirational women in Scotland in 2017 and MDUK Campaigner of the Year in 2018.
After graduating my short protest hip-hop film called ‘Tax On Me’ has been viewed by tens of thousands of people in Scotland, raising a parliamentary motion on the issue of Care Tax.</description>
