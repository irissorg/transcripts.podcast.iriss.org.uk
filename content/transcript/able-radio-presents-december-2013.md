MM = Michael McEwan

In this episode, guest presenter, Michael McEwan from Able Radio, gives us the latest roundup of news and events for people with disabilities.

Hello and welcome to another programme on Iriss.fm. My name is Michael McEwan. Coming up this month we will tell you about an international day of persons with a disability. We will also tell you a bit about a new initiative run by the Scottish Government, facilitated by the Social Ideas Factory. And if you want to get fit, well listen up and I will tell you how you can get involved in a 7-a-side disability football team.

First up this month, as you know I present the show every month here on Iriss.fm, but I also do a show once a week on Able Radio. Abel Radio is the UK's number one only disability radio station focusing on ability and disability. Abel Radio is on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I cover the whole of Scotland, so that means I am the Scotland correspondent and present it from Scotland. If you would like any news featured on the show, all you have to do is email michael@ableradio.com, that's michael@ableradio.com. I also take events, so if you are holding an event, you can email me as well. My show used to be on on a Sunday night, but now it's been moved to a Thursday night between 7 and 8. Please join me for news, events and brilliant music live from Scotland.

Next up this month we will tell you a bit about what's happening on the 3rd of December, it is International Day of Persons with a Disability. International Days of Persons with a Disability take place every year on the 3rd of December - it started in 1992, focusing on ability with people from all over the world. Now they hold different events, as I said, all over the world, so if you want to see what's on where and who is taking part on what event, all you have to do is visit the website, disabilitynorth.org.uk, that's disabilitynorth.org.uk. The UN International Day of Persons with a Disability is organised by the UN, focusing on people with a disability, so if you would want to see what's taking part in your area or in your country, all you have to do is email disabilitynorth.org.uk.

Coming up next, we will tell you a bit about a new initiative run by the Scottish Government and a Social Care provider called the Social Care Ideas Factory. The network is called Trendspotting. Trendspotting is a new ... it's out in your community, facilitated by the Social Care Ideas Factory, made up of people who require additional support needs with everyday living. The activities involved in shaping their rights and experience in this community. So basically what happens here, is when they want people to provide a service better, we want to know because we are reporting back to the Scottish Government. This funding is for 3 years and we have got money from the Scottish Government, so we would like people to come forward with their view and opinions about services, how we can improve services, how we can make it better and if they want a service and it's not in your area, please tell us that as well. You can find full details on Social Care Ideas Factory for more information on Trendspotting.

This month and for the rest of the year, I have set up a 7-a-side football team in Barrhead. It's been going since the beginning of the year. We want to find new members to join the football team, it's a good social environment and as well as playing football you can meet pals and we have social activities as well. So if you would like to come along to the football on a Monday night in Barrhead, all you have to do is email me, michael@abelradio.com, that's michael@ableradio.com, if you would like to take part in the football on a Monday night.

And that's it for Iriss.fm from me for this year, this is the December one, this is the last edition of the December one. I will be back next near with some more news and events. Keep it here on Iriss.fm for more news and events. It only leaves for me to say, this is Michael McEwan saying have a nice and safe Christmas, look after yourself and we will speak next year, here on Iriss.fm
